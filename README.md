KYC-as-a-Service Smart Contract

Overview

The KYC-as-a-Service Smart Contract provides a privacy-preserving identity verification framework on the Stacks blockchain.
It allows wallets to be linked with verified KYC providers without exposing sensitive personal details directly on-chain.
Instead, provider and document hashes are stored to maintain confidentiality while proving verification.

This contract enables:

Registration and management of KYC providers

Wallet-level KYC verification and tracking

Verification record storage for auditability

Verification updates, revocations, and level adjustments

Reputation scoring for providers

üîë Key Features
Provider Management

Register providers (only by contract owner).

Deactivate providers when no longer trusted.

Update provider reputation scores to reflect reliability.

Wallet Verification

Verify wallets through authorized providers with:

Verification level

Provider hash

Document hash (privacy-preserving)

Timestamp & verification ID

Prevent duplicate verifications per wallet.

Verification Lifecycle

Update verification levels (e.g., from basic ‚Üí advanced).

Revoke verification (only contract owner).

Store immutable verification records for auditing.

üöÄ Use Cases

DeFi Onboarding ‚Äì Allow DeFi apps to check wallet KYC status without handling raw identity data.

NFT Marketplaces ‚Äì Restrict participation to verified wallets.

DAO Memberships ‚Äì Assign voting rights based on verification level.

Cross-platform KYC Sharing ‚Äì Reduce repeated KYC checks across multiple apps.

üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security

Uses document hashes instead of storing raw documents.

Providers must be registered and active to issue verifications.

Contract owner retains control for revocation and governance.

‚úÖ Example Flow

Owner registers Provider A with reputation score.

Provider A verifies Wallet X with a document hash and verification level.

Wallet X is now verified and can be queried by dApps.

Later, Provider A upgrades Wallet X‚Äôs level or verification is revoked if trust is lost.
